            <h1>Travel</h1>
            <h5>Date: 09/02/2018</h5>
            <p>Traveling is not merely a means of relaxation and pleasure, but also an efficient way to learn and
                broaden
                the mind. Controversy arises whenever people are selecting destinations for their tours. Some argue
                that
                traveling around the homeland is more beneficial, while the reverse side advocates having a long
                journey
                abroad. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own unique advantages that can by no means be
                surpassed
                by the other. It is too rash to label either of them as the superior and more beneficial choice. On one
                hand,
                cross-cultural communication can be better carried out during overseas tours. It is a blessed
                opportunity
                to encounter and further understand different foreign cultures. Indeed, only after stepping onto the
                foreign
                land in person can one fully immerse himself in the real cultural surroundings that used to be read
                from
                books and seen from the screen. Just as the renowned saying goes, "When in Rome, do as the Romans do."
                Paying
                a visit to an alien nation makes it convenient to have direct contact with unique customs. For
                instance,
                once involved in the interactions with local restaurants, travelers could vividly experience the way
                they
                entertain guests and take orders. Having dinner at the home of some friends also helps visitors learn
                the
                different table manners and cooking methods. What's more, an efficient language atmosphere is being
                established
                throughout the trip. People may be able to practice speaking a foreign language with the local citizens
                through
                friendly chatting. Admittedly, there are also shortcomings to traveling abroad. For example, a longer
                list
                of fees that should be paid before and during the journey may add to one's financial burden. Figures
                released
                by the International Travel Agency indicate that a 10-day trip from China to America will cost as much
                as
                20,000 RMB per person. By contrast, a week-long national tour only charges 2,000 RMB. Besides,
                travelers
                have to be patient enough to go through complicated procedures, especial during the application for
                passport
                and visa. Many documents are required. On the other hand, touring around the homeland is also a good
                way
                to have intimate contacts with cultures in other parts of the country. People can hear the purest local
                dialects
                anywhere they visit, which can add to their pleasure. Moreover, appreciation of the magnificent scenery
                within
                the nation makes travelers pay more tribute and respect to their motherland. A stronger sense of pride
                will
                be cultivated and people will become more patriotic. With reference to the argument above, there should
                be
                no absolute superiority of either one to the other. People possess the right to decide which one is
                more
                suitable and beneficial for them. As a consequence, it is reasonable to conclude that an international
                tour
                is no worse than a trip inside the mother country.
